Some of the most common git commands I use are `git checkout` and `git add`. If it's very early in the morning and I'm sleepy then I might need to indlude the `--amend` flag when using the `git commit` command. ~~Just kidding of course!~~ :sweat_smile:

Here is a list of some of the things I am familiar with:
- Java
- Python
- C/C++
- Unix
- Shell Scripting

These are some of my academic and career goals:
- [x] Transfer to UCSD
- [ ] Complete undergraduate Computer Science degree program
- [ ] Find employment a Software Developer

### *Interests*
As a hobby, I like learning to make 3D models in [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)). You can see some of them here below. :slightly_smiling_face: I also like learning to use the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) for fun as well.

I enjoy this quote from the Dalai Lama:
> Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.
