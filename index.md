Some of the most common git commands I use are `git checkout` and `git add`. If it's very early in the morning and I'm sleepy then I might need to use the `--amend` flag when using the `git commit` command. 

Here is a list of some of the things I am familiar with:
- Java
- Python
- C/C++
- Unix
- Shell Scripting

These are some of my academic and career goals:
- [x] Transfer to UCSD
- [ ] Complete undergraduate Computer Science degree program
- [ ] Find employment a Software Developer

I enjoy this quote from The Dalai Lama:
> Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.
